        Here is a picture of Justin with his wonderful girlfriend Kenzie in the Colorado mountains.
        Justin is a senior pursing his undergraduates degree at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
        His major is Management of Information Systems with a concentration in Information Assurance and
        Computer Science. He previously was pursuing Cybersecurity. However, he decided that was not the exact major
        he wanted to graduate with. He knows that he loves technology and still wants to pursue smomething IT related.
        However, he wants to manage things and work somewhat with the business aspects as well. That is when we
        switched to MIS and discovered this is what he wanted to do. He still has knowledge of several programming
        languages such as Java, C, C++, HTML, Javascript, and ARM/Assembley. In his free time he loves to travel.
        Especially to Colorado with family. Click the link below to see more pictures like the one above.

        This is a very basic sample site to show off HTML and CSS knowledge.
        These abilities are essential for creating web apps.
