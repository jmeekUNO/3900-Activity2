Activity 2 - Practice HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub - You will create your own GitHub repository for this assignment. All future assignments will use a repository link provided by the instructor.

Objectives 
Demonstrate basic HTML and CSS skills by creating a simple web site. 
Learn to clone and push a completed activity to a GitHub Repository 
 
Directions 
Task 1: Complete Activity 1 posted to Canvas before beginning on this assignment. 
Task 2: Review the “GitHub and GitHub Desktop” tutorial before beginning this assignment. 
Task 3: Create a simple web site as defined.

Requirements: 
• Include at least one image.  
• Include at least two custom, linked pages. See grading rubric posted to Canvas for grading details.  
Pages may link to other, outside pages, but 2 custom pages with content must be included. 
• Include a stylesheet. 
• Creation of a shared, private github repository – add ‘svlasnik-uno’ as a Collaborator. This step should 
have been completed in Task 2 above. 
• Push all html, image files, and css files to your new github Activity 2 repository.  
 
Pushing Your Files to GitHub: 
• Be sure to preview your website frequently as you are building it. If you make changes after pushing 
files to GitHub, you will need to update the repo by pushing the updated files via GitHub Desktop.

This is a very simple biography about myself, Justin Meek. The foundation source code was written by Professer Vlasnik.
I modified the code to become my own webpage with her permission.
